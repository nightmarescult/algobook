# What is it?
This is a handbook for competitive programming. My goal is to create a simple, understandable, and detailed tutorial on this topic. The site runs on [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), a blazingly fast site generator written in Rust. The site is inspired by [e-maxx](https://e-maxx.ru/algo), its english alternative: [cp-algorihtms](https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html) and [algorithmica](https://ru.algorithmica.org/). Unfortunately, currently only in russian language (sorry).
